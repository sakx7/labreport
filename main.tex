    \section{Abstract}
    \vspace*{1em}
    This study investigated the effects of two thermal treatments on the mechanical properties of HE30/BS1476 aluminium alloy, initially characterized by a hardness of 120 HV5, an elastic modulus of 6 GPa, and an ultimate tensile strength of 500 MPa. The alloy underwent two heat treatments: first, heating for 90 minutes at 520\textdegree C, followed by an additional 40 minutes at 184\textdegree C in open air. Three distinct alloy variations were produced as a result of these treatments. The aim of the research was to quantify changes in hardness, modulus of elasticity, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength (UTS), and percentage elongation. Hardness was measured using a Zwick Roell ZHU hardness testing machine with a 5 kg load (HV5) (See Appendix A), and properties such as stress and strain were derived from data obtained using a Zwick Roell 2050 tensile testing machine.

\section{Introduction}

In engineering, the selection and optimization of materials significantly influence the performance of designs, particularly in the aerospace, automotive, and construction industries. Aluminium alloys are highly valued in these sectors due to their excellent strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance, especially in applications requiring mechanical improvements through controlled processes (thyssenkrupp, 2023).\\[8pt]
Research by metallurgists such as Sorby and Sauveur has demonstrated that \textbf{heat treatment} can significantly enhance the properties of alloys. By altering the microstructure, heat treatments improve tensile strength, hardness, and elasticity. Techniques such as quenching and solution heat treatment are tailored to achieve specific mechanical properties based on the alloyâ€™s intended application (Eurotherm, 2024).\\[8pt] 
\textbf{Aging} is a heat treatment process used to enhance the mechanical properties of aluminum alloys. It involves two main stages: first, the alloy is heated to dissolve alloying elements and then rapidly cooled, creating a supersaturated solid solution. Following this, the alloy undergoes artificial aging, where it is reheated to a lower temperature for a set period. This allows for the formation of fine particles that strengthen the material by impeding dislocation movement, thereby improving its hardness and tensile strength. Aging is crucial for optimizing the performance of aluminum alloys used in various applications (Rajaa et al., 2018).\\[8pt]
The significance of heat treatments is further supported by research. In one study, for example, the hardness of Al 6082 alloy increased from 65 BHN to 102 BHN after 8 hours of solution heat treatment. Furthermore, the alloy's tensile strength increased from 154 MPa to 280 MPa after being aged for 6 hours at 205\textdegree C and 495\textdegree C (Singh et al., 2023). Aluminium alloys like HE30 are ideal for demanding applications in the automotive and aerospace industries because of these microstructural improvements.\\[8pt]
This research investigates the response of HE30 aluminium alloy to thermal treatments, focusing on changes in its mechanical properties.

\newpage\vspace*{-20pt}
\section{Method}
This laboratory research primarily focused on evaluating the mechanical properties of our alloy samples, including key metrics such as yield strength, ultimate tensile strength (UTS), modulus of elasticity, hardness, and percentage elongation. These properties are essential for understanding the material's behavior under stress and assessing its suitability for various engineering applications.\\[8pt]
The methodologies employed in this study were designed to optimize the data obtained from individual experiments on the alloys. By utilizing advanced data analysis techniques such as \textbf{Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and Fraction Factorial Design (FFD)} (See Appendix C), we uncovered correlations and dependencies that might otherwise remain hidden. For instance, tensile testing, beyond yielding basic parameters like UTS and modulus of elasticity, provided insights into failure mechanisms and material behavior under specific conditions. This approach reduces the need for extensive experimental operations while deepening our understanding of the alloys' properties and enabling predictive modeling. By focusing on a minimal set of tests that deliver insights into multiple material properties, the methodology ensures each procedure is maximally informative, minimizing resource usage and reducing the likelihood of error.\\[8pt]
Building on this optimized experimental design, the research approach utilized in this study incorporates an \textbf{Integrated Testing Strategy (ITS)}. ITS combines collected data to provide a comprehensive and precise assessment of the alloy's mechanical properties. It reduces redundancy and streamlines the evaluation process by avoiding reliance on a single test or series of tests. As an example of broader interdisciplinary efforts, the ITS developed in this study was designed to reduce operational costs, minimize resource consumption, and shorten the time required to carry out processes (Rovida et al., 2015; Alan Turing Institute, 2024)\\[8pt]
Our approach was characterized by the following key procedures:
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=-0.5mm]
    \item Dimensional Analysis
    \item Hardness Testing
    \item Tensile Testing 
    \item Data Analysis
\end{enumerate}
\footnote{Note that \textbf{Sample Preparation} is separate from the testing process and is not included as part of the testing itself; therefore, it is not considered a part of the list of procedures in the experiment we conducted.} By designing the experiment with this set of procedures, each offering multiple insights through its respective process, we were able to perform a comprehensive evaluation of the alloy's mechanical properties. This approach minimized time, resource consumption and potential errors, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the results while providing a robust dataset for detailed analysis and interpretation of the alloy's performance characteristics.

\newpage

\section{Experimental Procedures}
The alloys employed in this study originate from HE30/BS1476. The designation HE30 pertains to a temper classification established under the now-defunct BS 1476 standard, which detailed the heat treatment and aging protocols for aluminium alloys. Introduced in 1955 and revised until 1987, BS 1476 was formally withdrawn on June 21, 2022.\\[8pt]
Despite the withdrawal of BS 1476, the temper designation HE30 remains intrinsically linked to the aluminium alloy 6082, a material extensively utilized in engineering applications. Although the precise parameters defined by BS 1476 are no longer accessible, HE30 is consistently correlated with 6082 and its well-documented temper conditions:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=1pt]
    \item \textbf{T6}: Solution heat-treated and artificially aged.
    \item \textbf{O}: Fully annealed (softened state).
    \item \textbf{T4}: Solution heat-treated and naturally aged.
    \item \textbf{T651}: Solution heat-treated, stress-relieved, and artificially aged.
\end{itemize}
The absence of BS 1476 does not hinder the characterization of HE30, as the chemical composition of 6082 is standardized under EN 573-3, which aligns with internationally recognized specifications for this alloy. While BS 1476 specifies HE30, BS EN 573-3 defines 6082-T6, ensuring continuity in the alloy's description and application (Acton Bright Steel, 2024).

\subsection{Description}
Key details are as follows:
\begin{formal}[Truventor, 2019]
Aluminium HE 30 alloy a.k.a AL 6082 is a medium strength alloy with excellent corrosion resistance. It has the highest strength of 6000 (6XXX) series alloys. It is also known as a structural alloy. In block, plate, or bar form, AL HE 30 alloy is most commonly used in machining.\\[8pt]
Although it is a relatively new alloy, due to its higher strength, AL HE 30 has replaced AL 6061 in many applications. The addition of a large amount of manganese controls the grain structure which in turn results in a stronger alloy.\\[8pt]
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.57\textwidth}
    \textbf{Characteristics:}
    \begin{itemize}[itemsep=-1mm]
    \item High strength-to-weight ratio makes it ideal for lightweight structures.
    \item Most versatile and highest strength alloy in the 6000 series Aluminum.
    \item Good machinability compared to metals like Stainless Steel (SS) and Mild Steel (MS).
    \item Lightweight and corrosion-resistant components.
    \item Alternative to plastics in high-stress applications.
    \item Lower fatigue strength and elastic strength compared to steels.
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}\hspace{2.4em}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.45\textwidth}
\textbf{Applications:}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=-1mm]
    \item Automotive components.
    \item Electronic applications.
    \item Aerospace components.
    \item Trusses, frames, and beams.
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}\\
\vspace{1pt}
\end{formal}
\newpage\noindent
Aluminium alloy 6082 and HE30 are corresponding designations, though not precisely equivalent, with minor differences in composition and performance (aalco, 2019). As BS 1476, which defines HE30, was withdrawn in 2022, obtaining its exact specifications would require consulting the British Standards Institution (BSI). For this study, we will treat HE30 as equivalent to 6082, simplifying the analysis of the alloy's properties and subsequent discussions, while acknowledging potential slight differences.

\begin{minipage}{0.53\textwidth}
    The composition of 6082 conforms to the standard specifications for this aluminium alloy at the BS EN 573-3:2009, as detailed in Table \ref{tab:composition_6082}. These values are consistent with industry standards for 6082, providing a foundation for further analysis.\\[8pt]
    Once again, I stress that there may be minor differences in the composition of HE30, especially in accordance with the BS 1476 specifications.\\[8pt] 
    The values listed here are provided for reference, but the exact composition of the specifci HE30 alloy we used should be verified for accurate work in our lab, as it may not align with typical web standards.
    \vspace{1em}\hrule\vspace{1em}
    Although I do have actual information regarding the "Aluminium alloy to the HE30 BS1476 specification" from Dr. Santiago shown in Table \ref{tab:composition_he30}, it is important to note that this source lacks proper documentation, and its credibility remains uncertain.\\[8pt]
    The BS1476 has been withdrawn and has not been explicitly updated or replaced, as I stated. It is still largely unreferenced and not widely recognised in the contemporary literature. So this data provided contradicts to much of what is being currently pertaining to the standard.\\[8pt]
    Although there are significant differences between the two sources in terms of composition, I have chosen to adopt Dr. Santiago's version for the purpose of this work. This decision is based on the fact that the table he provided reflects the information he, as my instructor, has shared with me. While I acknowledge the discrepancies and the lack of clear sourcing in his data, I consider it appropriate to proceed with his version for expediency, particularly as it aligns with the guidance he has given in our coursework.

\subsection{Heat Treatments and Alloy Conditions}
Each sample was treated under different conditions to evaluate the effect of heat treatment on its mechanical properties. The samples were provided in the typical bone-shaped form for tensile testing. The heat treatment conditions are as follows:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=-1mm]
    \item \textbf{AR (As Received)}: The sample was used without any heat treatment, in its initial state as supplied.
    
    \item \textbf{ST (Solution Treatment)}: The sample was heated at 520\textdegree C for 90 minutes to dissolve precipitates, improving ductility. The exact quenching method is unspecified.
    
    \item \textbf{PH (Precipitation Hardening)}: The sample was first heated at 520\textdegree C for 90 minutes, followed by aging at 184\textdegree C for 40 minutes to enhance strength and hardness.
\end{itemize}
These treatments were applied to assess how they influence the alloy's mechanical properties.

\section{Conducting the Experiment}
For the experiment, we were provided with three samples, which are visually represented in the image below:

    \caption{Visual representation of the three samples} 
    \label{fig:samples} 
\end{figure}
\newpage\noindent
Additionally, we were given an A4 sheet with a form to complete, which looked as shown below:

\end{figure}

\textbf{General Overview:}
The experiment was conducted in two phases: measuring the dimensions and hardness of alloy samples, followed by testing their tensile properties with the Zwick Roell 2050 Tensile Testing Machine. \\[8pt]
In the first phase, the width and length of each sample were recorded using digital calipers (in millimeters), while hardness was measured with a Vickers Hardness test machine using the HV5 scale. These tasks were conducted simultaneously, as both are quick and independent processes.\\[8pt]
After documenting the dimensions and hardness on the data sheet (See Figure \ref{fig:alloys}), we proceeded to the second phase of the experiment. Each sample was subjected to a controlled tensile force until fracture using the Zwick Roell 2050 Tensile Testing Machine. The data, including force applied and change in length, was recorded and summarized in a shared graph and table for all three alloys. This data was printed on an A4 sheet (See Figure \ref{fig:tensile_results}) and provided for further analysis outside the lab. Key parameters such as stress, strain, ultimate tensile strength, yield strength, and elongation these parameters were calculated after the experiment and are presented as a key part of the analysis in this report.\\[8pt]
The following subsections detail the use of the equipment, outlining each step of the procedure and the results obtained at each stage.\\

We measured the dimensions of each alloys gauge region using a digital calliper and recorded the results on the data sheet ( \ref{fig:alloys}). We were informed that the gauge length was 50 mm, but we did not measure it ourselves. Although checking measurements is good practice, this analysis does not require it because the gauge length has no bearing on the cross-sectional area (CSA), further explained below.

    In a tensile test, force is applied from the top and bottom of the alloy, stretching it along its length. Stress is calculated as the force divided by the area \textbf{perpendicular} to the applied force. Thus, the appropriate cross-sectional area for stress calculation is the one that is perpendicular to this force.\footnotemark

\subsection{Hardness Test}
To test the hardness of our alloys, we chose the Vickers hardness (HV) test, a precise and versatile method for evaluating material hardness, among others (see Appendix A). This method employs a diamond-shaped indenter with a square base and an included angle of 136\textdegree \ between opposing faces (See Figure \ref{fig:vickers-diagram}).\\
\vspace{7pt}
\begin{minipage}{0.55\textwidth}
    The indenter is pressed into the material under a specific load, typically ranging from 1 to 100 kgf, applied for 10 to 15 seconds. In our case, we applied a load of 5N for a duration of around 1-5 seconds.\\[8pt]
    The process began by pressing the indenter onto the alloy surface, creating an indent. Afterward, using a dial, we adjusted the two parallel lines to align with the indent, measuring the first distance, \(d_1\), ensuring the indent was accurately positioned between the two sides (See Figure \ref{fig:vickers}). \\[8pt]  
    Once the first measurement was confirmed, we repositioned the sample and took the second distance measurement, \(d_2\), for the indent.\\[8pt]
    Finally, once both distances were recorded by the machine, we pressed a button to calculate the hardness.
\end{minipage}\hspace{1em}
\begin{minipage}{0.4\textwidth}\centering
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/1024px-Vicker_Hardness_-_Diamond_Indentation.jpg}
    \caption{Illustration showing the indent and the parallel lines used for measuring the indentation. (Wikipedia)}
    \label{fig:vickers}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}\\
\vspace{10pt}
To ensure accuracy and consistency, this process was done at least 2-3 times for each given alloy and the resulting hardness values were recorded on the data sheet (See Figure \ref{fig:alloys}) for later analysis.\\[8pt]
Although the machine automatically calculates the hardness, it is important to understand the underlying process. The diagonals of the indentation $d_1$ and $d_2$ are used to calculate the Vickers hardness by determining the surface area of the indent. This area depends on the average of the two diagonal measurements, $d_1$ and $d_2$, as well as the geometry of the indentation. Together, these provide the necessary data to compute the material's hardness, i demonstrate and derive the pertinent equation and calculation for the HV5 test within theory section (See Subsection \ref{VHC}).

The recorded results were documented on the data sheet (See Figure \ref{fig:alloys}) and were as follows:\\

\subsection{Tensile Test}

    \label{fig:tensile_machine}
    \end{figure}
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.555\textwidth}
This phase of the experiment focused on evaluating the alloy's mechanical properties through tensile testing. A tensile testing machine similar to the one depicted in Figure \ref{fig:tensile_machine} was employed.\\[8pt]
An axial load was applied to the standardised dog-bone-shaped alloy as part of the destructive test procedure. The alloy, which had a precisely sized gauge area, was held firmly at both ends and extended at a regulated pace until it broke.\\[8pt]
The tensile tester used in this lab was a Zwick machine, with a maximum load capacity of 50 kN and an adjustable pulling rate. For analysis, a plot of force (N) versus elongation (mm) was generated in real-time during the experiment. This process was automated using the software provided by the manufacturer. It is worth noting that the machine did not account for the thickness or width of the sample, as these dimensions were not directly relevant to the data collected.
\end{minipage}\\[8pt]
 Technically, the initial length of the specimen is also not required, since the plot records the change in length starting from zero. Consequently, it is necessary for us to establish the relationship between the generated data and the initial measurements (e.g., cross-sectional area and original gauge length). While it may seem that providing the machine with the cross-sectional area and initial gauge length could have directly yielded a stress-strain curve, it is likely that this approach was deliberately avoided to encourage independent analysis and a deeper understanding of the process.\\[8pt]
The procedure followed during the tensile test was as follows: 
\begin{itemize} 
    \item We ensured all safety precautions, including wearing safety glasses and maintaining a safe distance (approximately 1.5 meters) from the equipment while the test was running. \\
    \item Upon initiating the test by clicking the "Start" button, the upper and lower grips moved in opposite directions according to the set pulling rate. We carefully observed the experiment from a safe distance, noting the failure mode when the specimen failed. \\
\end{itemize}
The first noticeable event was necking, where the material started to undergo localized plastic deformation. This was clearly visible in the force-elongation plot, as the elongation increased significantly without a corresponding rise in force, indicating that the material was weakening at the necked region. Following necking, the specimen exhibited different behaviors depending on its material properties: in some cases, necking continued to propagate slowly, and the specimen was able to elongate further before breaking; in other cases, the necking intensified rapidly, leading to a quicker failure. The rate of necking progression can vary significantlyâ€”some materials may exhibit slow, stable necking before ultimate fracture, while others can experience rapid fracture soon after necking begins, especially in brittle or less ductile alloys. The force-elongation plot captures these differences, showing a sharp drop in force once the material reaches its breaking point, which is evident in See Figure \ref{fig:force_elong}.


   \section{Theory}
    In this section, i aim to provide the theoretical foundations that underpin the methods and analyses conducted in this experiment. "Theory" refers to the conceptual framework and principles that guide our understanding of the phenomena we are investigating. It includes the mathematical models, formulas, and relationships that form the basis for our experimental approach, as well as the reasoning behind the techniques used.\\[8pt]
    This section will cover key concepts related to the Vickers hardness test, including the definition of hardness, the mechanism behind the indentation process, and the equations used to calculate Vickers hardness. Additionally, it will include essential topics related to the tensile test, such as the calculation of stress and strain, the construction of stress-strain curves, and the analysis of material behavior under tensile loading.\\[8pt]
    By understanding these fundamental principles, we can effectively interpret our experimental results and perform accurate calculations. This section will also address other relevant concepts, such as the Young's modulus, yield strength, and the significance of failure modes in materials.\\[8pt]
    This theory section serves as the foundation for the subsequent experimental procedures and data analysis, ensuring that our conclusions are based on a sound understanding of the relevant scientific principles.

       \end{minipage}\hfill
       \begin{minipage}{0.51\textwidth}
           The Vickers hardness (HV) is calculated using the applied force (\(F\)) and the surface area (\(A\)) of the indentation. 
           \begin{equation}
               \text{HV} = \frac{F}{A}
           \end{equation}
           \begin{itemize}[itemsep=-1mm]
               \item HV: Vickers hardness (dimensionless)
               \item \(F\): Applied force (kgf or N)
               \item \(A\): Surface area of the indentation (mm\(^2\))
               
           \end{itemize}
           The formula for $A$ incorporates the geometry of the diamond pyramid indenter, 
           Such that surface area \(A\) can be expressed as:
           \begin{equation}
               A = \frac{d^2}{2\sin\left(\frac{136^\circ}{2}\right)} \approx \frac{d^2}{1.854} 
           \end{equation}
           Where:  
           \begin{itemize}[itemsep=-1mm]
               \item \(A\): Surface area of the indentation (mm\(^2\))
               \item \(d\): Arithmetic mean of the diagonals \(d_1\) and \(d_2\) (mm)
           \end{itemize}
           in so that it can be rewritten in terms of the diagonals as so:
           \begin{equation}
               A= \frac{\left(\frac{d_1+d_2}{2}\right)^2}{2\sin\left(\frac{136^\circ}{2}\right)} \approx \frac{\left(d_1 + d_2\right)^2}{7.236}
           \end{equation}
       \end{minipage}\\
   \end{figure}
   \vspace{-1em}\noindent
   Thus the derived formula is commonly shown as
   \begin{equation}
       {\text{HV} = \frac{F}{A} \approx \, \frac{1.854 \times F}{d^2} \approx \, \frac{7.236\times F}{\left(d_1 + d_2\right)^2}}    
   \end{equation} 
   The HV5 test we conducted applied a fixed load of 5 kgf (49.03 N), and the hardness was calculated via the machine as:  
   \begin{equation}
       \text{HV5} = \frac{49.03}{A} \approx \, \frac{90.902}{d^2} \approx \, \frac{354.781}{\left(d_1 + d_2\right)^2}
   \end{equation}
   Values for \(d_1\) and \(d_2\) were determined using the machine dial, and the corresponding hardness values were calculated based on them.\footnote{It is important to note that the resulting hardness value is expressed as a dimensionless number.}\\[8pt]

\end{figure}
    
    The similarity between the Force vs Elongation graph and the Stress vs Strain graph arises from the underlying relationship between force, elongation, stress, and strain. In the Force vs Elongation graph, force (in Newtons) is plotted against the change in length (elongation, in millimeters), showing the direct relationship between the applied load and the resulting deformation. However, in the Stress vs Strain graph, both force and elongation are scaled down by constants: force is divided by the cross-sectional area of the specimen, and elongation is divided by the original gauge length of the specimen. This scaling reduces the magnitude of the values in the Stress vs Strain graph, which is why the graph appears smaller, even though the overall shape and behavior are similar. Specifically, stress represents force per unit area, and strain represents the relative change in length, both of which are dimensionless or have smaller units compared to force and elongation. Therefore, the difference in graph scales is simply due to this division by constants, which doesn't affect the overall shape of the curve but rather scales the values down, making the Stress vs Strain graph appear "smaller" than the Force vs Elongation graph.

\subsection{BHN (Brinell Hardness Number)}
The Brinell Hardness Number (BHN) measures a material's resistance to deformation, determined by the indentation left by a hard steel or carbide ball pressed into the material under a specified load. This test is commonly used for materials with a coarse or heterogeneous grain structure.\\[1em]
The formula for calculating the Brinell Hardness Number is:
\begin{equation}
    BHN = \frac{2P}{\pi D (D - \sqrt{D^2 - d^2})}
\end{equation}
Where:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=-1mm]
    \item \( P \) : applied load in kilogram-force (kgf),
    \item \( D \) : diameter of the indenter (typically 10 mm),
    \item \( d \) : diameter of the indentation (mm).
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Note}: The Brinell test may use either $P$ or $F$ for the load, depending on the source.\\ 
The BHN provides insight into a material's ability to resist wear and deformation, which is important for assessing the durability and suitability of metals in various engineering applications. BHN values are particularly useful for testing larger, rougher materials and are commonly applied to metals like steel and cast iron. The results help predict wear resistance and strength under load.


\subsection{RSM and FFS}
\textbf{Response Surface Methodology (RSM)} is a type of adaptive or sequential design. Sequential designs involve multiple rounds of experimentation, with the choice of treatments in each later round being dependent on the data accumulated from completed rounds. RSM is usually used to identify some sort of optimum, often for industrial production. Sequential designs also exist outside of the RSM framework, however, such as Bayesian Adaptive Experimental Design.\\[8pt]
\textbf{Fractional Factorial Designs (FFDs)} are a specific group of experimental designs. They allow useful information to be extracted from relatively tiny experiments, especially in situations with a large number of predictors. The central (quite reasonable) assumption is that higher-order interactions are less important than lower-order ones and main effects, which is called the "sparsity-of-effects principle". Experimental designs can therefore be scaled down by neglecting the higher-order interactions. This scaling down involves intentionally confounding (â€˜aliasingâ€™) combinations of factors relative to the full factorial experiment, with the consequence that one cannot estimate each separate main effect and interaction term. We can still learn a great deal of useful information from the data despite this limitation, though.\\[8pt]
\textbf{How RSM and FFDs interact:}\\[8pt]
FFDs are most often used as a component of RSM. But they can in principle be used independently, either as part of a one-shot experiment, or as part of a sequential design approach that does not involve RSM. They seem unlikely to be very useful when used in a one-shot experiment, which is probably why they are so tightly connected to RSM.\\[8pt]
Additionally, RSM can take as its input experimental designs that are not FFDs. Central Composite Designs and Box-Behnken designs are two other commonly-used designs.\\[8pt]
My thanks to kjetil b halvorsen and Gregg H for their input and the suggested resources. I was not able to lay my hands on the Montgomery book but found the Box, Hunter \& Hunter book very useful.

\subsection{Mean/Average}

The mean, or average, of a set of values is calculated by summing all individual values and dividing by the total number of values, as shown by the formula:

\begin{equation}
    \text{Mean} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n}
\end{equation}
Were:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=-1mm]
    \item \textbf{Mean} : The arithmetic average of a dataset, representing the central tendency of the values.
    \item \( x_i \) : Each individual value in the dataset.
    \item \( n \) : The total number of values in the dataset.
    \item \( \sum x_i \) : The sum of all the individual values.
\end{itemize}
