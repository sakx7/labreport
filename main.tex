    \section{Abstract}
    \vspace*{1em}
    This study investigated the effects of two thermal treatments on the mechanical properties of HE30/BS1476 aluminium alloy, initially characterized by a hardness of 120 HV5, an elastic modulus of 6 GPa, and an ultimate tensile strength of 500 MPa. The alloy underwent two heat treatments: first, heating for 90 minutes at 520\textdegree C, followed by an additional 40 minutes at 184\textdegree C in open air. Three distinct alloy variations were produced as a result of these treatments. The aim of the research was to quantify changes in hardness, modulus of elasticity, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength (UTS), and percentage elongation. Hardness was measured using a Zwick Roell ZHU hardness testing machine with a 5 kg load (HV5) (See Appendix A), and properties such as stress and strain were derived from data obtained using a Zwick Roell 2050 tensile testing machine.

\section{Introduction}

In engineering, the selection and optimization of materials significantly influence the performance of designs, particularly in the aerospace, automotive, and construction industries. Aluminium alloys are highly valued in these sectors due to their excellent strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance, especially in applications requiring mechanical improvements through controlled processes (thyssenkrupp, 2023).\\[8pt]
Research by metallurgists such as Sorby and Sauveur has demonstrated that \textbf{heat treatment} can significantly enhance the properties of alloys. By altering the microstructure, heat treatments improve tensile strength, hardness, and elasticity. Techniques such as quenching and solution heat treatment are tailored to achieve specific mechanical properties based on the alloyâ€™s intended application (Eurotherm, 2024).\\[8pt] 
\textbf{Aging} is a heat treatment process used to enhance the mechanical properties of aluminum alloys. It involves two main stages: first, the alloy is heated to dissolve alloying elements and then rapidly cooled, creating a supersaturated solid solution. Following this, the alloy undergoes artificial aging, where it is reheated to a lower temperature for a set period. This allows for the formation of fine particles that strengthen the material by impeding dislocation movement, thereby improving its hardness and tensile strength. Aging is crucial for optimizing the performance of aluminum alloys used in various applications (Rajaa et al., 2018).\\[8pt]
The significance of heat treatments is further supported by research. In one study, for example, the hardness of Al 6082 alloy increased from 65 BHN to 102 BHN after 8 hours of solution heat treatment. Furthermore, the alloy's tensile strength increased from 154 MPa to 280 MPa after being aged for 6 hours at 205\textdegree C and 495\textdegree C (Singh et al., 2023). Aluminium alloys like HE30 are ideal for demanding applications in the automotive and aerospace industries because of these microstructural improvements.\\[8pt]
This research investigates the response of HE30 aluminium alloy to thermal treatments, focusing on changes in its mechanical properties.

\newpage\vspace*{-20pt}
\section{Method}
This laboratory research primarily focused on evaluating the mechanical properties of our alloy samples, including key metrics such as yield strength, ultimate tensile strength (UTS), modulus of elasticity, hardness, and percentage elongation. These properties are essential for understanding the material's behavior under stress and assessing its suitability for various engineering applications.\\[8pt]
The methodologies employed in this study were designed to optimize the data obtained from individual experiments on the alloys. By utilizing advanced data analysis techniques such as \textbf{Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and Fraction Factorial Design (FFD)} (See Appendix B), we uncovered correlations and dependencies that might otherwise remain hidden. For instance, tensile testing, beyond yielding basic parameters like UTS and modulus of elasticity, provided insights into failure mechanisms and material behavior under specific conditions. This approach reduces the need for extensive experimental operations while deepening our understanding of the alloys' properties and enabling predictive modeling. By focusing on a minimal set of tests that deliver insights into multiple material properties, the methodology ensures each procedure is maximally informative, minimizing resource usage and reducing the likelihood of error.\\[8pt]
Building on this optimized experimental design, the research approach utilized in this study incorporates an \textbf{Integrated Testing Strategy (ITS)}. ITS combines collected data to provide a comprehensive and precise assessment of the alloy's mechanical properties. It reduces redundancy and streamlines the evaluation process by avoiding reliance on a single test or series of tests. As an example of broader interdisciplinary efforts, the ITS developed in this study was designed to reduce operational costs, minimize resource consumption, and shorten the time required to carry out processes (Rovida et al., 2015; Alan Turing Institute, 2024)\\[8pt]
Our approach was characterized by the following key procedures:
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=-0.5mm]
    \item Dimensional Analysis
    \item Hardness Testing
    \item Tensile Testing 
    \item Data Analysis
\end{enumerate}
\footnote{Note that \textbf{Sample Preparation} is separate from the testing process; therefore, it is not considered a part of the list of procedures in the experiment 'we' conducted.} By designing the experiment with this set of procedures, each offering multiple insights through its respective process, we were able to perform a comprehensive evaluation of the alloy's mechanical properties. This approach minimized time, resource consumption and potential errors, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the results while providing a robust dataset for detailed analysis and interpretation of the alloy's performance characteristics.

\newpage

\section{Experimental Procedures}
The alloys employed in this study originate from HE30/BS1476. The designation HE30 pertains to a temper classification established under the now-defunct BS 1476 standard, which detailed the heat treatment and aging protocols for aluminium alloys. Introduced in 1955 and revised until 1987, BS 1476 was formally withdrawn on June 21, 2022.\\[8pt]
Despite the withdrawal of BS 1476, the temper designation HE30 remains intrinsically linked to the aluminium alloy 6082, a material extensively utilized in engineering applications. its well-documented temper conditions include:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=1pt]
    \item \textbf{T6}: Solution heat-treated and artificially aged.
    \item \textbf{O}: Fully annealed (softened state).
    \item \textbf{T4}: Solution heat-treated and naturally aged.
    \item \textbf{T651}: Solution heat-treated, stress-relieved, and artificially aged.
\end{itemize}
The absence of BS 1476 does not hinder the characterization of HE30, as the chemical composition of 6082 is standardized under EN 573-3, which aligns with internationally recognized specifications for this alloy. While BS 1476 specifies HE30, BS EN 573-3 defines 6082-T6, ensuring continuity in the alloy's description and application (Acton Bright Steel, 2024).

\subsection{Description}
Key details are as follows:
\begin{formal}[Truventor, 2019]
Aluminium HE 30 alloy a.k.a AL 6082 is a medium strength alloy with excellent corrosion resistance. It has the highest strength of 6000 (6XXX) series alloys. It is also known as a structural alloy. In block, plate, or bar form, AL HE 30 alloy is most commonly used in machining.\\[8pt]
Although it is a relatively new alloy, due to its higher strength, AL HE 30 has replaced AL 6061 in many applications. The addition of a large amount of manganese controls the grain structure which in turn results in a stronger alloy.\\[8pt]
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.57\textwidth}
    \textbf{Characteristics:}
    \begin{itemize}[itemsep=-1mm]
    \item High strength-to-weight ratio makes it ideal for lightweight structures.
    \item Most versatile and highest strength alloy in the 6000 series Aluminum.
    \item Good machinability compared to metals like Stainless Steel (SS) and Mild Steel (MS).
    \item Lightweight and corrosion-resistant components.
    \item Alternative to plastics in high-stress applications.
    \item Lower fatigue strength and elastic strength compared to steels.
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}\hspace{2.4em}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.45\textwidth}
\textbf{Applications:}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=-1mm]
    \item Automotive components.
    \item Electronic applications.
    \item Aerospace components.
    \item Trusses, frames, and beams.
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}\\
\vspace{1pt}
\end{formal}
\newpage\noindent
Aluminium alloy 6082 and HE30 are corresponding designations, though not precisely equivalent, with minor differences in composition and performance (aalco, 2019). As BS 1476, which defines HE30, was withdrawn in 2022, obtaining its exact specifications would require consulting the British Standards Institution (BSI). For this study, we will treat HE30 as equivalent to 6082, simplifying the analysis of the alloy's properties and subsequent discussions, while acknowledging potential slight differences.

\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.53\textwidth}
    The composition of 6082 conforms to the standard specifications for this aluminium alloy at the BS EN 573-3:2009, as detailed in Table \ref{tab:composition_6082}. These values are consistent with industry standards for 6082, providing a foundation for further analysis.\\[8pt]
    Once again, I stress that there may be minor differences in the composition of HE30, especially in accordance with the BS 1476 specifications.\\[8pt] 
    The values listed here are provided for reference, but the exact composition of the specifci HE30 alloy we used should be verified for accurate work in our lab, as it may not align with typical web standards.
    \vspace{1em}\hrule\vspace{1em}
    Although I do have actual information regarding the "Aluminium alloy to the HE30 BS1476 specification" from Dr. Santiago shown in Table \ref{tab:composition_he30}, it is important to note that this source lacks proper documentation, and its credibility remains uncertain.\\[8pt]
    The BS1476 has been withdrawn and has not been explicitly updated or replaced, as I stated. It is still largely unreferenced and not widely recognised in the contemporary literature. So this data provided contradicts to much of what is being currently pertaining to the standard.\\[8pt]
    Although there are significant differences between the two sources in terms of composition, I have chosen to adopt Dr. Santiago's version for the purpose of this work. This decision is based on the fact that the table he provided reflects the information he, as my instructor, has shared with me. While I acknowledge the discrepancies and the lack of clear sourcing in his data, I consider it appropriate to proceed with his version for expediency, particularly as it aligns with the guidance he has given in our coursework.

\subsection{Heat Treatments and Alloy Conditions}
Each sample was treated under different conditions to evaluate the effect of heat treatment on its mechanical properties. The samples were provided in the typical bone-shaped form for tensile testing. The heat treatment conditions are as follows:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=-1mm]
    \item \textbf{AR (As Received)}: The sample was used without any heat treatment, in its initial state as supplied.
    
    \item \textbf{ST (Solution Treatment)}: The sample was heated at 520\textdegree C for 90 minutes to dissolve precipitates, improving ductility. The exact quenching method is unspecified.
    
    \item \textbf{PH (Precipitation Hardening)}: The sample was first heated at 520\textdegree C for 90 minutes, followed by aging at 184\textdegree C for 40 minutes to enhance strength and hardness.
\end{itemize}
These treatments were applied to assess how they influence the alloy's mechanical properties.

\section{Conducting the Experiment}
For the experiment, we were provided with three samples, which are visually represented in the image below:
\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Visual representation of the three samples} 
    \label{fig:samples} 
\end{figure}
\newpage\noindent
Additionally, we were given an A4 sheet with a form to complete, as shown below:

    \label{fig:alloys} 
\end{figure}

\textbf{General Overview:}
The experiment was conducted in two phases: measuring the dimensions and hardness of alloy samples, followed by testing their tensile properties with the Zwick Roell 2050 Tensile Testing Machine. \\[8pt]
In the first phase, the width and length of each sample were recorded using digital calipers (in millimeters), while hardness was measured with a Vickers Hardness test machine using the HV5 scale. These tasks were conducted simultaneously, as both are quick and independent processes.\\[8pt]
After documenting the dimensions and hardness on the data sheet (See Figure \ref{fig:alloys}), we proceeded to the second phase of the experiment, were each sample was subjected to a controlled tensile force until fracture using the Zwick Roell 2050 Tensile Testing Machine. The data, including force applied vs change in length was recorded on a shared graph for all three alloys, this along with a table outlining key metrics for the respective graphs.\\[8pt] 
This information was printed on an A4 sheet and given for additional examination outside of the lab (see Figure \ref{fig:tensile_results}). Important parameters, including stress, strain, yield strength, uts, and others are to be calculated after the experiment and are presented as a key part of analysis in this report.\\[8pt]
The following subsections detail the use of the equipment, outlining each step of the procedure.\\

We measured the dimensions of each alloys gauge region using a digital calliper and recorded the results on the data sheet (See Figure \ref{fig:alloys}). We were informed that the gauge length was 50 mm, but we did not measure it ourselves. Although checking measurements is good practice, it was determined the cross-sectional area (CSA) analysis does not require it, as shown below, however it is needed for further analysis in the data section.

\subsection{Hardness Test}
To evaluate the hardness of our alloys, we employed the Vickers Hardness (HV) test, among others methods (See Section \ref{hardnesstypes}).\\[8pt]
The Vickers Hardness (HV) test is known as a precise and versatile method for measuring material hardness through indentation. It employs a diamond-shaped indenter with a square base at an included angle of 136\textdegree \ between opposing faces (See Figure \ref{fig:vickers-diagram}) (Ultramag, 2024; ZwickRoell, 2024).\\

\vspace{7pt}
\begin{minipage}{0.55\textwidth}
    The indenter is pressed into the material under a specific load, typically ranging from 1 to 100 kgf\footnotemark, applied for 10 to 15 seconds (Ultramag, 2024). In our case, a load of 5 kgf (approximately \SI{49.03}{\newton}) was applied for a duration of approximately 1â€“5 seconds. This test is referred to as HV5.\\[8pt]
    The process began by pressing the indenter onto the alloy surface, creating an indent. Afterward, using a dial, we adjusted the two parallel lines to align with the indent, measuring the first distance, \(d_1\), ensuring the indent was accurately positioned between the two sides (See Figure \ref{fig:vickers}). \\[8pt]  
    Once the first measurement was confirmed, we repositioned the sample and took the second distance measurement, \(d_2\), for the indent.\\[8pt]
    Finally, once both distances were recorded by the machine, we pressed a button to calculate the hardness.

\vspace{10pt}
\footnotetext{{1 kilogram-force (kgf) is the force exerted by one kilogram of mass under standard gravity (\SI{9.81}{\meter\per\second\squared}), approximately equal to \SI{9.81}{\newton}.}}
To ensure accuracy and consistency, this process was done at least 2-3 times for each given alloy and the resulting hardness values were recorded on the data sheet (See Figure \ref{fig:alloys}) for later analysis.\\[8pt]
Although the machine automatically calculates the hardness, it is important to understand the underlying process. The Vickers hardness is determined by a fixed force and the indentation area, which is calculated using the average of the diagonals $d_1$ and $d_2$, along with the indentation geometry (ZwickRoell, 2024). I demonstrate and derive the pertinent equation and calculation for the HV5 test within theory section (See Section \ref{meanhard}).

\subsection{Tensile Test}
This phase of the experiment focused tensile testing to assess the alloy's mechanical characteristics, particularly its tensile strength and elongation. The tensile tester used in this lab was a {Zwick machine}, with a maximum load capacity of 50 kN and an adjustable pulling rate (See Figure \ref{fig:tensile_machine}).\\[8pt]
An axial load was applied to the standardised dog-bone-shaped alloy as part of the destructive test procedure. The alloy, which had a precisely sized gauge length, was held firmly at both ends and extended at a regulated pace until it broke.\\[8pt]
For analysis, a real-time plot of force (N) versus change in length (mm) was generated during the experiment.
\end{minipage}\\[8pt]
Once the test was completed, i.e., after the specimen broke, the system also provided a table outlining details such as \textbf{Maximum Load (N)} \& \textbf{Extension at Break (mm)} \footnote{Table title terminology has been reworded for clarity. The original table titles are phrased strangely and incorrectly in a sense. A more detailed explanation and possible justification is provided in a later section.}. This process was automated using the manufacturer's software. The machine did not account for the sample's thickness or width, or simply by observation it was not given, making the data for these parameters invalid.\\[8pt]
Consequently, it is necessary for us to establish the relationship between the generated data and the initial measurements (e.g., cross-sectional area and original gauge length) (See Section \ref{Measurements}). While it may seem that providing the machine with the cross-sectional area and initial gauge length could have directly yielded a stress-strain curve, and correct data in the table, it is likely that this approach was deliberately avoided to encourage independent analysis and a deeper understanding of the process. There will be more discussion on this later on.

    \label{fig:alloys_next_graph}
\end{figure}
This stress-strain graph, though not produced during our lab, illustrates key regions corresponding to visual changes in the alloy. While our real-time force vs. change in length graph isn't a true stress-strain curve, it represents similar principles due to proportional relationships. Thus, observed deformations can be linked to these stages. (For Further explanations see Section \ref{discuss}).\\[8pt]
The procedure followed during the tensile test was as follows: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We ensured all safety precautions, including wearing safety glasses and maintaining a safe distance (approximately 1.5 meters) from the equipment before starting the test.
    \item Upon initiating the test by clicking the "Start" button, the upper and lower grips moved in opposite directions according to the set pulling rate.
    \item The initial \textbf{elastic deformation region}, where the material experienced reversible stretching, was not noticeably perceptible in the alloys if not closely observant, due to the small change in length during this phase.\footnote{This region also corresponds to the LÃ¼ders region, where some materials undergo localized yielding before uniform plastic deformation. Whether this occurred in our alloy is uncertain, as I do not observe it in the graph produced by the machine (see Figure \ref{fig:tensile_results}). Regardless, no visible change in the material's shape or bands is seen during this phase.}
    \item Following the elastic region, the material enters the \textbf{uniform plastic deformation region}, where the material elongates uniformly across the specimen, and the elongation becomes more noticeable, with no localized necking occurring as of yet.
    \item The first noticeable event was \textbf{necking}, which visually manifests as a localized narrowing of the material at the gauge length region, indicating the onset of plastic deformation. This region is where the material started to stretch disproportionately at a certain point.
\end{enumerate}
\newpage
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[6.] After necking, in the \textbf{non-uniform plastic deformation region}, the graph displayed distinct behaviors (though the earlier regions also exhibited varying characteristics in the rate of change) depending on the alloy being tested (see Figure \ref{fig:stress_strain}):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For the solution-treated (ST) alloy, necking continued to propagate slowly, allowing further elongation before breaking, with the neck widening visibly before final failure.
        \item For the as-received (AR) and precipitation-hardened (PH) alloys, necking intensified rapidly, resulting in a more pronounced narrowing of the specimen and leading to quicker fracture.
    \end{itemize}
    The plot produced captured these differences, showing a sharp drop in force once the material reached its breaking point (See Figure \ref{fig:force_elong}).
\end{enumerate}
Once all three alloys broke, we were left with a shared force vs. change in length data and a table of results from the machine for all three alloys, this was to be printed all on an A4 sheet by ZwickRoell.\\

   \subsection{Hardness}\label{hardnesstypes}
    Hardness is a material property that measures its resistance to deformation, scratching, or penetration by external forces. It is a critical factor in evaluating the durability and wear resistance of materials, often used in material science and engineering to determine suitability for specific applications.\\[8pt]
    The concept of hardness is multifaceted, encompassing several types:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Scratch Hardness}: The resistance of a material to scratching, often assessed using the Mohs scale, which ranks materials based on their ability to scratch one another.
        \item \textbf{Indentation Hardness}: This measures resistance to permanent deformation under localized pressure, typically using methods like the Brinell, Vickers, Rockwell or Knoop hardness tests.
        \item \textbf{Rebound Hardness}: The ability of a material to resist impact, evaluated through methods such as the Shore scleroscope test.
    \end{itemize}
    These approaches rely on different theoretical principles. For instance, indentation hardness tests use mathematical models to relate the force applied and the resulting deformation, often involving elastic and plastic deformation mechanics. The Mohs scale, on the other hand, is more qualitative and based on empirical observations.\\[8pt]
    Understanding hardness is essential in applications ranging from manufacturing to material selection, where wear resistance, strength, and surface durability are critical considerations.

        \end{minipage}\hfill
        \begin{minipage}{0.51\textwidth}
            The Vickers hardness (HV) is calculated using the applied force (\(F\)) and the surface area (\(A\)) of the indentation. 
            \begin{equation}
                \text{HV} = \frac{F}{A}
            \end{equation}
            Where:
            \begin{itemize}[itemsep=-1mm]
                \item HV: Vickers hardness (dimensionless)
                \item \(F\): Applied force (kilogram-force, \(\text{kgf}\)) or (Newtons, \(\text{N}\))
                \wm{\item \(A\): Surface area of the indentation (millimetres \\squared, \(\text{mm}^2\))}            
            \end{itemize}
            The formula for $A$ incorporates the geometry of the diamond pyramid indenter, such that surface area \(A\) can be expressed as:
            \begin{equation}
                A = \frac{d^2}{2\sin\left(\frac{136^\circ}{2}\right)} \approx \frac{d^2}{1.854} 
            \end{equation}
            \begin{itemize}[itemsep=-1mm]
                \wm{\item \(A\): Surface area of the indentation (millimetres \\squared, \(\text{mm}^2\))}
                \item \( d \): Arithmetic mean of the diagonals \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \) (millimetres, \(\text{mm}\))
            \end{itemize}
            so that it can be expressed in terms of the diagonals as follows:
            \begin{equation}
                A= \frac{\left(\frac{d_1+d_2}{2}\right)^2}{2\sin\left(\frac{136^\circ}{2}\right)} \approx \frac{\left(d_1 + d_2\right)^2}{7.236}
            \end{equation}
        \end{minipage}\\
    \end{figure}
    \vspace{-1em}\noindent
    Thus the derived formula is commonly shown as
    \begin{equation}
        {\text{HV} = \frac{F}{A} \approx \, \frac{1.854 \times F}{d^2} \approx \, \frac{7.236\times F}{\left(d_1 + d_2\right)^2}}    
    \end{equation} 
    The HV5 test we conducted applied a fixed load of 5 kgf (49.03 N), and the hardness was calculated via the machine as:  
    \begin{equation}
        \text{HV5} = \frac{49.03}{A} \approx \, \frac{90.902}{d^2} \approx \, \frac{354.781}{\left(d_1 + d_2\right)^2}
    \end{equation}
    Values for \(d_1\) and \(d_2\) were obtained from the machine dial, and the corresponding hardness values were calculated accordingly. It is worth noting, if not already disclosed, that the resulting HV and HV5 values are expressed as dimensionless numbers. \\[1em]
    \hrule\vspace{1em}
    Going into detail about each type of hardness, along with their specific equations and characteristics, seems excessive for this context. I concentrated on Vickers hardness because it directly relates to the test we performed. Although i aim for this theory section to cover a broad theoretical background, my goal is to include only the information that is specifically relevant to this report. If you're interested, relevant equations and descriptions for \textbf{indentation types} can be found in Appendix A.

    \subsection{Tensile Testing}
    
    \begin{formal}[iqytechnicalcollege, 2012]
        Tensile testing is used to establish operational load limits for metals and alloys. A sample of the material is prepared so that a force can be applied along its axis. A central portion of the sample is reduced in width so that it will experience the highest stresses.\\[8pt]
        The tensile test measures the ability of a material to support a stress (force per unit area). The response of a tensile sample to the application of an increasing stress can be described in terms of elastic and plastic behavior. Initially, the sample undergoes elastic elongation as it is pulled. As increasing stress is applied, the sample undergoes permanent deformation; that is, plastic strain.\\[8pt]
        A stress-strain curve is used to determine the point at which the reversible elastic strain is exceeded and permanent or plastic deformation occurs. The yield strength is the stress necessary to cause significant plastic deformation (usually defined as 0.2\% strain).\\[8pt]
        Youngâ€™s modulus, or the modulus of elasticity, states the relationship between stress and strain represented by the straight-line portion of the stress-strain curve. It reflects the tendency of a material to deflect under a given applied stress.\\[8pt]
        Once yielding has begun, there is significant motion of dislocations within the metal grains. Grain boundaries, phase boundaries, and other dislocations hinder their movement. As more obstacles are encountered, the stress necessary to cause continued dislocation movement becomes greater. The maximum stress that the material can withstand before breaking is the ultimate tensile strength.\\[8pt]
        Reduction of area and percent elongation can be calculated from the broken sample. They are both indicators of a materialâ€™s ductility.\\

     Stress and strain are fundamental concepts in tensile testing:\\[8pt]
     \subsection{Stress}
     \textbf{Stress} ($\sigma$) is the force divided by the cross-sectional area where that force is applied perpendicular to the material. In a tensile test, the area is constant (initial area $A_0$), while the applied force ($F$) changes, Mathematically, it is expressed as:\\[8pt]
    \begin{minipage}{0.46\textwidth}
            \begin{equation}
                \sigma = \frac{F}{A}
                \label{eq:strain}
            \end{equation}
            \begin{itemize}[left=0pt,itemsep=-1mm]
            \wm{\item \(\sigma\): Stress (Pascals, Pa) or (Newtons per metre, \(\text{N/m}^2\))}
            \wm{\item \(F\): Applied force (Newtons, N)}
            \wm{\item \(A\) or \(A_0\): Cross-sectional area (metres squared, \(\text{m}^2\))}
            \end{itemize}
        \end{minipage}\hfill
        \begin{minipage}{0.47\textwidth}
            \begin{equation}
                A_0 = w \times d
                \label{eq:csa}
            \end{equation}
            \begin{itemize}[left=0pt,itemsep=-1mm]
                \wm{\item \(A_0\): Initial cross-sectional area (meters squared, \(\text{m}^2\))}
                \wm{\item \(w\): Width (meters, \(\text{m}\))}
                \wm{\item \(d\): Depth or thickness (meters, \(\text{m}\))}            
            \end{itemize}
        \end{minipage}\\[8pt]
        The final stress should be expressed in Newtons per meter, in so unit conversions must be applied where necessary to achieve that.
        \newpage
        
        Stress ($\sigma$) is a measure of how much internal resistance a material has against external forces that try to change its shape. It indicates how a material responds to applied loads, detailing the intensity of the internal force for each unit area.\\[8pt]
        Understanding stress is essential for analyzing how materials deform under various loading conditions and is crucial for evaluating their strength and structural integrity, especially before any yielding or plastic deformation takes place.        
        
        \subsection{Strain}
        Strain ($\varepsilon$) is defined as the ratio of the change in length ($\Delta L$) to the original length ($L_0$) of the material, where these lengths refer to the gauge length used in a tensile test. The original length \(L_0\) is constant, and the change in length \(\Delta L\) varies. Unlike stress, strain is a dimensionless quantity because it indicates how much a material stretches or compresses in response to stress, without having any units. It can be mathematically expressed as:\\[8pt]
        
        \begin{minipage}{0.48\textwidth}
            \begin{equation}
                \varepsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0}
                \label{eq:stress}
            \end{equation}
            \begin{itemize}[left=0pt,itemsep=-1mm]
                \item \( \varepsilon \): Strain (no units)
                \item \( \Delta L \): Change in length (meters, \(\text{m}\))
                \item \( L_0 \): Original length (meters, \(\text{m}\))    
            \end{itemize}
        \end{minipage}\hfill
        \begin{minipage}{0.48\textwidth}
            \begin{equation}
                \Delta L = \left| L - L_0 \right|
                \label{eq:deltaL}
            \end{equation}
            \begin{itemize}[left=0pt,itemsep=-1mm]
                \item \( \Delta L \): Change in length (meters, \(\text{m}\))
                \item \( L \): Current length (meters, \(\text{m}\))
                \item \( L_0 \): Original length (meters, \(\text{m}\))
            \end{itemize}
        \end{minipage}\\[8pt]
        Unit conversions should ensure that $\Delta L$ and $L_0$ are in the same units, with the final strain ($\varepsilon$) being unitless.\\[8pt]
        Strain ($\varepsilon$) measures how much a material deforms when a force is applied. It reflects the change in length relative to the material's original length.\\[8pt]
        Grasping the concept of strain is essential for understanding how materials behave under load, especially regarding their elasticity. It shows whether a material can return to its original shape after the load is removed (elastic deformation) or if it will undergo permanent deformation (plastic deformation). Because it helps determine the point at which a material may fail or become permanently deformed.
        
    \subsection{Young's Modulus}
    \textbf{Young's Modulus} (\(E\)) (also known as \textit{Modulus of Elasticity}) defines the relationship between stress (\(\sigma\)) and strain (\(\varepsilon\)) as a linear fraction. It represents the rate at which stress leads to strain in a material and is determined from the tensile test within the elastic region. Mathematically, it is expressed as:
    \begin{equation}
        E = \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon} 
        \label{eq:ym}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{itemize}[itemsep=-1mm]
        \item \( E \): Young's modulus (Pascals, Pa) or (Newtons per metre, \(\text{N/m}^2\)).
        \item \( \sigma \): Stress Pascals (Pascals, Pa) or (Newtons per metre, \(\text{N/m}^2\))
        \item \( \varepsilon \): Strain (no units).
    \end{itemize}    
    \newpage
    
    The formulas for stress (\ref{eq:stress}) and strain (\ref{eq:strain}) can be used to expand the equation, and if needed, \ref{eq:deltaL} and \ref{eq:csa} can be incorporated for further elaboration. This can also be written as follows\footnote{Relevant units and variables are from the equations named, so i will not do an itemize for this}:
    \begin{equation}
        E = \frac{F \times L_0}{A\times\Delta L} = \frac{F \times L_0}{\left(w\times d\right)\left(|L-L_0|\right)}
    \end{equation}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/stress-strain-youngs-modulus2.jpg}
\caption{Stress and Strain graph showing Young's Modulus in the elastic region.}
\label{fig:young}
\end{figure}

    {Young's Modulus} ($E$) is a fundamental material property that describes the relationship between stress ($\sigma$) and strain ($\varepsilon$) in the elastic region of a material's deformation. It represents the stiffness of a material, indicating how much strain will occur in response to a given stress.\\[8pt] 
    
    In the context of the tensile test, Young's Modulus is determined from the linear portion of the stress-strain curve, known as the elastic region, where the material deforms proportionally to the applied load, as shown above (See Figure \ref{fig:young}). Within this region, the material will return to its original shape once the load is removed, and the relationship between stress and strain is linear.\\[8pt] 

    Young's Modulus is important because it measures how stiff a material is, which is essential for choosing the right materials in engineering and construction.
    \begin{itemize}[itemsep=-0.5mm]
        \item \textbf{High }\(\bm{E}\): A higher Young's Modulus indicates that the material is stiffer, allowing it to resist deformation more effectively when stress is applied.\\[3pt] 
        This property is particularly advantageous in scenarios where minimal elastic deformation is crucial, such as in the design of structural components or precision instruments.
        \item \textbf{Low }\(\bm{E}\): Conversely, materials with a lower Young's Modulus are more flexible and may be more appropriate for applications that require compliance or the ability to absorb energy.
    \end{itemize}    

    \newpage

    \subsection{Hooke's Law}
    One might see Hooke's law and be confused since this relates to springs, but here i show how the stress-strain, Young's modulus relationship interlinks with it. Hooke's Law is a fundamental principle in mechanics that describes the relationship between applied force and deformation in elastic materials.\\[8pt]
    In its simplest form, Hooke's Law states that:
    \begin{equation}
        F = kx
    \end{equation}
    Where:
    \begin{itemize}[itemsep=-1mm]
        \item $F$: Applied force (Newtons, N)
        \item $k$: Spring constant (Newtons per metre, N/m)
        \item $x$ Displacement (metres, m)
    \end{itemize}
    Note displacement is from equilibrium position\\[8pt] 
    This principle applies not only to springs but also to any elastic material. Here i prove such a thing, we begin with the stress-strain relationship, Young's Modulus (\(E\)) \ref{eq:ym} in tensile testing \footnote{Most equations presented here are meant only for derivation purposes (to prove my point). They consist of straightforward rearrangements and are not meant to be individually referenced at any particular moment; hence, they are not numbered.}:    
    \[E = \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon}\]
    \begin{center}
    Rearranging this equation to solve for stress (Multiply both sides by \(\varepsilon\)), we get:
    \[\sigma = E\varepsilon\]
    Next, we substitute the definition of stress as force (\(F\)) divided by the cross-sectional area (\(A\)):
    \[\frac{F}{A} = E\varepsilon\]
    To isolate the force (\(F\)), we multiply both sides by the cross-sectional area (\(A\)):
    \[F = A \times E\varepsilon\]
    Now, recall that strain (\(\varepsilon\)) is defined as the ratio of the change in length (\(\Delta L\)) to the original length (\(L_0\)):
    \[F = A \times E\frac{\Delta L}{L_0}\]
    Simplifying further, we get:
    \[F = \left(\frac{AE}{L_0}\right)\Delta L\]
    Since the cross-sectional area (\(A\)), Young's Modulus (\(E\)), and the original length (\(L_0\)) are constants, we can combine them into a new constant \(k = \frac{AE}{L_0}\), so the equation becomes:
    \begin{equation}
        F = k\Delta L
    \end{equation}
    Here, \(k = \frac{AE}{L_0}\) is the effective spring constant, which represents the material's resistance to deformation, analogous to the spring constant in Hooke's Law.    
    \end{center}
    \newpage



\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
This essentially proves that the extension (\(\Delta L\)) of the elongated body is proportional to the applied force (\(F\)), provided the limit of proportionality is not exceeded. 
\begin{equation}
    \Delta L \propto F
\end{equation}
This derivation demonstrates how Hooke's Law, typically associated with springs, applies to elastic materials in general.\\[8pt] 
However, it's crucial to understand the limitations and broader applications of this principle.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The law assumes a linear relationship between stress and strain, which holds true only in the elastic region (See Figure \ref{fig:young}).
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
    \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/hook(1).png}
    \caption{Illustration of the Stress-Strain Relationship Under Hookeâ€™s Law}
    \label{fig:hook}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=3mm]
    \item In so, Hooke's Law is valid only within the elastic limit of a material, where deformation is reversible. Beyond this limit, permanent deformation occurs, and the stress-strain relationship becomes non-linear.
    \item Temperature significantly affects material properties, including Young's Modulus, altering material stiffness.
\end{itemize}
The linear behavior up to the elastic limit is due to the proportional stretching of atomic bonds relative to the applied force. This allows for reversible deformation. Beyond the elastic limit, atomic bonds begin to permanently deform, leading to plastic deformation and deviation from linearity.\\[8pt]
Several misconceptions surround Hooke's Law, one of which is: \\[8pt]
\textbf{Instantaneous Response:} It is often mistakenly assumed that materials respond immediately to applied loads, disregarding time-dependent behaviors such as \textbf{creep} or \textbf{stress relaxation}. While I acknowledge this misconception, it will not be covered here. \\[8pt]
As analysed Hooke's Law extends beyond simple spring systems. When subjected to dynamic loading conditions, materials can behave differently than they do in static situations. Complex shapes with uneven stress distributions often necessitate advanced methods, such as finite element analysis, to accurately forecast their responses. Furthermore, composite materials exhibit complex stress-strain relationships that differ from the straightforward nature of homogeneous materials.\\[8pt]
This principle is essential in areas like energy storage and structural design, where materials need to withstand applied stresses without undergoing permanent deformation. A thorough understanding of Hooke's Law, its limitations, and its relationship with Young's Modulus is vital for effectively modeling and engineering material behavior across various applications.

    
    
    \newpage
    \subsection{Yield Strength}
%    Yield strength is the maximum stress a material can withstand before it permanently changes shape. It's a crucial property for engineers to understand when designing components, as it helps determine the maximum load a material can safely support. Yield strength is typically determined from a stress-strain curve, where it marks the transition from elastic deformation to plastic deformation. Materials with high yield strength are preferred in structural applications to avoid permanent deformation under load.  
    
    \subsection{Modulus of Resilience}
    The modulus of resilience is a mechanical property that measures how much energy a material can absorb and store without permanently deforming. This property is essential for applications where materials are subjected to sudden loads or shocks, such as in springs, fasteners, and crash-resistant structures.\\[8pt]  
    The modulus of resilience is calculated by integrating the stress-strain curve up to the elastic limit. The formula for the modulus of resilience is:  
    \[\frac{1}{2}\sigma_y\varepsilon_y\]  
    $\sigma_y$: The yield stress of the material\\  
    $\varepsilon_y$: The strain at the elastic limit\\[8pt]  
    The units of the modulus of resilience are the same as the units of strain energy density, which are Joules per cubic meter (J/m\(^{3}\)) in the SI system.  
    
    \subsection{Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS)}
%    Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS) represents the maximum stress a material can withstand while being stretched before it breaks. It is one of the most important properties for assessing a material's ability to resist failure under tensile loads. UTS is determined from a stress-strain curve as the peak stress value before fracture. This property is critical for ensuring safety in applications like cables, bridges, and load-bearing components.  
    
    \subsection{Elongation at Break}
%    Elongation at break measures the extent to which a material can stretch before it fractures. It reflects the ductility of the material, which is its ability to deform plastically without breaking. High elongation values indicate that the material is highly ductile, making it suitable for forming and shaping processes. Conversely, low elongation values suggest brittleness.  
    
    \subsubsection{Percentage Elongation}
    Percentage elongation is a specific measure of elongation at break expressed as a percentage of the original length of the material. It is calculated using the formula:  
    \[\text{Percentage Elongation} = \left(\frac{L_f - L_0}{L_0}\right) \times 100\]  
    Where \(L_f\) is the final length at fracture, and \(L_0\) is the original length. This metric is often used in tensile testing to compare the ductility of different materials.  
    
    \subsection{Toughness}
%    Toughness represents a material's ability to absorb energy up to the point of fracture. It is the combination of both strength and ductility, which determines how well a material can withstand stress before failure. Toughness is an essential property for applications where impact resistance and the ability to withstand sudden loading or deformation are critical, such as in automotive, aerospace, and construction industries. The toughness of a material is determined by measuring the area under the entire stress-strain curve, which includes both the elastic and plastic deformation regions.  
    
    \subsubsection{Modulus of Toughness}
%    The modulus of toughness is a related but distinct concept. It quantifies the total energy per unit volume that a material can absorb before fracturing, considering the area under the entire stress-strain curve. This measure gives insight into the material's capacity to withstand large amounts of energy before failure, typically used in applications where materials experience extreme stress or sudden impacts. While toughness indicates overall energy absorption, the modulus of toughness provides a normalized measure, considering energy per unit volume.
    
    \subsection{Slimness Ratio}
    The slimness ratio, also known as the slenderness ratio, is a dimensionless parameter that measures the propensity of a structural element to buckle under axial loads. It is crucial in evaluating the stability of columns and similar structural members. A higher slimness ratio indicates a greater tendency to buckle, making it a critical consideration in structural design and stability analysis.\\[8pt]    
    The slimness ratio is defined as:  
    \[\lambda = \frac{L_{\text{eff}}}{r}\]  
    Where:\\  
    - \(\lambda\) is the slenderness ratio.\\  
    - \(L_{\text{eff}}\) is the effective length of the member (length between points of zero moment).\\ 
    - \(r\) is the radius of gyration, given by \(r = \sqrt{\frac{I}{A}}\), where \(I\) is the moment of inertia and \(A\) is the cross-sectional area.\\[8pt]   
    Alternatively, for practical applications, the slimness ratio can also be approximated as:  
    \[\lambda = \frac{L_g}{\sqrt{A}}\]  
    Where: \\ 
    - \(L_g\) is the gauge length.\\  
    - \(A\) is the cross-sectional area.\\[8pt]     
    Understanding and calculating the slimness ratio ensures that structural components are designed with appropriate stability margins to prevent buckling under load.

%    \subsection{Poisson's Ratio}

        \item Gauge dimensions
        \item Hardness (v5)
        \item Force vs. elongation graph
    \end{itemize}
    We can now derive several mechanical properties:
    
    These derived properties will help us fully characterize the mechanical performance of the material under stress.
    \newpage
    \subsection{Hardness Data}\label{meanhard}
    While we've gone over the important equations for the Vickers hardness test, in this prior theory section (See Section \ref{VHC}) there's no need to actually do the calculations by hand since the machine has already provided the results. I hope this much is clear by now.\\[8pt]

    \end{center}
    To calculate the mean (or average) for each set of values, 
    sum all individual values and divide by the total number of values, as shown by the formula:
    \begin{equation}
        \text{Mean} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n}
    \end{equation}
    Where:
    \begin{itemize}[itemsep=-1mm]
        \item \textbf{Mean}: The arithmetic average, representing the central tendency of the dataset.
        \item \( x_i \): Each individual value in the dataset.
        \item \( n \): The total number of values in the dataset.
        \item \( \sum x_i \): The sum of all individual values.
    \end{itemize}
    Before calculating the mean, it is important to identify and remove outliers. 
    During the lab, it was determined that the value \textbf{102.8 from PH was an outlier}. With this adjustment, the results can now proceed as follows:\\
    \begin{center}

    \begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}\centering
        \textbf{ST:}
        \[\sum x_i = 36 + 36.8 = 72.8\]

    \section{Discussion}\label{discuss}
    The similarity between the Force vs Elongation graph and the Stress vs Strain graph arises from the underlying relationship between force, elongation, stress, and strain. In the Force vs Elongation graph, force (in Newtons) is plotted against the change in length (elongation, in millimeters), showing the direct relationship between the applied load and the resulting deformation. However, in the Stress vs Strain graph, both force and elongation are scaled down by constants: force is divided by the cross-sectional area of the specimen, and elongation is divided by the original gauge length of the specimen. This scaling reduces the magnitude of the values in the Stress vs Strain graph, which is why the graph appears smaller, even though the overall shape and behavior are similar. Specifically, stress represents force per unit area, and strain represents the relative change in length, both of which are dimensionless or have smaller units compared to force and elongation. Therefore, the difference in graph scales is simply due to this division by constants, which doesn't affect the overall shape of the curve but rather scales the values down, making the Stress vs Strain graph appear "smaller" than the Force vs Elongation graph.

\subsection{Indentation hardness types}
The Brinell Hardness Number (BHN) measures a material's resistance to deformation, determined by the indentation left by a hard steel or carbide ball pressed into the material under a specified load. This test is commonly used for materials with a coarse or heterogeneous grain structure.\\[1em]
The formula for calculating the Brinell Hardness Number is:
\begin{equation}
    BHN = \frac{2P}{\pi D (D - \sqrt{D^2 - d^2})}
\end{equation}
Where:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=-1mm]
    \item \( P \) : applied load in kilogram-force (kgf),
    \item \( D \) : diameter of the indenter (typically 10 mm),
    \item \( d \) : diameter of the indentation (mm).
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Note}: The Brinell test may use either $P$ or $F$ for the load, depending on the source.\\ 
The BHN provides insight into a material's ability to resist wear and deformation, which is important for assessing the durability and suitability of metals in various engineering applications. BHN values are particularly useful for testing larger, rougher materials and are commonly applied to metals like steel and cast iron. The results help predict wear resistance and strength under load.


\subsection{RSM and FFS}
\textbf{Response Surface Methodology (RSM)} is a type of adaptive or sequential design. Sequential designs involve multiple rounds of experimentation, with the choice of treatments in each later round being dependent on the data accumulated from completed rounds. RSM is usually used to identify some sort of optimum, often for industrial production. Sequential designs also exist outside of the RSM framework, however, such as Bayesian Adaptive Experimental Design.\\[8pt]
\textbf{Fractional Factorial Designs (FFDs)} are a specific group of experimental designs. They allow useful information to be extracted from relatively tiny experiments, especially in situations with a large number of predictors. The central (quite reasonable) assumption is that higher-order interactions are less important than lower-order ones and main effects, which is called the "sparsity-of-effects principle". Experimental designs can therefore be scaled down by neglecting the higher-order interactions. This scaling down involves intentionally confounding (â€˜aliasingâ€™) combinations of factors relative to the full factorial experiment, with the consequence that one cannot estimate each separate main effect and interaction term. We can still learn a great deal of useful information from the data despite this limitation, though.\\[8pt]
\textbf{How RSM and FFDs interact:}\\[8pt]
FFDs are most often used as a component of RSM. But they can in principle be used independently, either as part of a one-shot experiment, or as part of a sequential design approach that does not involve RSM. They seem unlikely to be very useful when used in a one-shot experiment, which is probably why they are so tightly connected to RSM.\\[8pt]
Additionally, RSM can take as its input experimental designs that are not FFDs. Central Composite Designs and Box-Behnken designs are two other commonly-used designs.\\[8pt]
My thanks to kjetil b halvorsen and Gregg H for their input and the suggested resources. I was not able to lay my hands on the Montgomery book but found the Box, Hunter \& Hunter book very useful.
